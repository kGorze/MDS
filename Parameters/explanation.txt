NOT EVERYTHING IS CHECKED, BUT I THINK THIS IS CORRECT. IF YOU WANT THE CLARIFICATION OF ANYTHING, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
IMPORTANT FOR THE PROGRAMMERS - (**************)
--
**************
deltaT = 0.005:
This is the time step for the simulation.
It determines the size of each step in the integration of the equations of motion.

--

density = 0.5:
This is the density of the system being simulated.

--
**************
initUcell = 5 5:
This specifies the initial configuration of particles in a unit cell.
It suggests a 5x5 grid of particles in a 2D simulation.

--

stepAvg = 50:
This indicates how often the system properties are averaged or recorded.
--

stepEquil = 0:
This is the number of steps used for equilibration before data collection begins. In this case, it's set to 0, meaning no equilibration period.
--
**************
stepLimit = 100:
This is the total number of simulation steps to be performed.

--

temperature = 1.0:
This sets the initial temperature of the system.

--

limitVel = 4:
This is related to the velocity distribution calculation.
It specifies how many times the velocity distribution should be calculated.

--

rangeVel = 3.0:
This sets the range for the velocity distribution histogram.

--
**************
sizeHistVel = 50:
This specifies the number of bins in the velocity distribution histogram.

--
**************
stepVel = 5:
This determines how often the velocity distribution is calculated (every 5 steps in this case).

--
**************
randSeed = 18:
This is the seed for the random number generator, ensuring pseudo reproducibility of the simulation.

--
**************
numberOfDimensions = 2:
This specifies that the simulation is being run in two dimensions.
