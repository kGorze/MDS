parent:: [[_2 Molecular Dynamic Simulation MOC]]

## Project Name
Molecular Dynamic Simulator - Simulates the molecular dynamics of atoms.

---
## Project Description
**This is an academic project focused on developing a molecular dynamics simulator.** Currently, it simulates Lennard-Jones (LJ) forces using a (less efficient) all-pairs algorithm on a 2D Boltzmann lattice of atoms.

**Am not familiar with Docker yet**,  so here's a breakdown of the "toolchain" dependencies needed for the project:
Those are the files required to:
- run the main program, this is a zip archive with **Google test framework library** and **external libraries(inih, matplotplusplus).**

- visualize the atom coordinates, this is a zip with **python scripts**

### Initial Conditions: 
Velocities and accelerations are **randomly assigned**, preventing the exact reproduction of simulations at present.

### Data Output: 
Each iteration is saved with **coordinates**, **physical properties**, and **velocity distribution** for later analysis.

### Visualization:
A separate **Python script** utilizing Pygame generates a visual representation of the atomic plane.

### Calculations:

### Visualization:
**Color coded** made by python script: 
```

**No colour coded** by python script:
```
draw_atoms_no_color_coded.py

## Project Status
**This project is in its initial stages.** The ultimate goal is a 3D simulation of water and solutes, but the current focus is on achieving a stable 2D simulation of atoms.
### Stability:
The 2D simulation functionality is still under development.

---
## Features

The project employs a director-builder pattern to create a simulation object. The `computeForces` function calculates the forces acting on the atoms.

---
## Requirements
### For main program

#### Development Environment:
CLion
#### Compiler:
Likely GCC (**as used by CLion**)

### For python visualizations
pygame

## Contribution and Issue Reporting
Feel free to fork the project or report issues for collaboration. No formal oversight exists yet.

---
## License
The code is freely reusable. The license for the book-based portions is still under consideration.
