Properties

--
Step Count: The current simulation step
Time Now: The current simulation time
3-4. Velocity Sum Value X/Y: Sum of velocities in X and Y directions (should be close to zero for momentum conservation)
5-6. Potential Energy Sum/Squared: For calculating average and variance of potential energy
7-8. Kinetic Energy Sum/Squared: For calculating average and variance of kinetic energy
9-10. Pressure Sum/Squared: For calculating average and variance of pressure

Each row represents a timestep in the simulation. The data shows how these properties evolve over time. Notable observations:
Velocity sums remain close to zero, indicating momentum conservation.
Potential energy remains fairly constant.
Kinetic energy decreases over time.
Pressure starts positive but becomes increasingly negative.

Results

--
The output is in CSV format. Each line represents a simulation step (iteration). The first column indicates the step number, while the second and third columns provide the x and y coordinates of an atom in a 2D simulation.

For example, with two atoms, the CSV would look like this:

1, 0.7, 0.3
1, 0.0, 0.0
2, 0.73, 0.21
2, 0.5, 0.2
3, 0.81, 0.15
3, 0.6, 0.4
This represents three iterations of two atoms:

Line 1: Iteration 1, Atom 1 (x, y)
Line 2: Iteration 1, Atom 2 (x, y)
Line 3: Iteration 2, Atom 1 (x, y)
Line 4: Iteration 2, Atom 2 (x, y)
Line 5: Iteration 3, Atom 1 (x, y)
Line 6: Iteration 3, Atom 2 (x, y)
To obtain the coordinates of Atom 1, you would use lines 1, 3, 5, and so on.

Velocity Distribution

--

The output is a CSV file where each line represents a vector of values. The vector length is defined in the configuration and corresponds to the number of velocity bins. Each index within a vector indicates the number of particles in the corresponding velocity bin. The CSV includes multiple iterations of these vectors, allowing for the analysis of distribution evolution over time.
